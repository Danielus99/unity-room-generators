# Installation

Create a Unity project (preferably Unity 2019 for prototype 1 and Unity 6 for prototype 2) and save the scripts for the desired prototype in the project's Assets. Then insert the scripts into the scene, preferably in an empty GameObject or GameManager object, and configure the parameters to make it work properly.

Optionally, insert the SeedGenerator.cs script alongside the others to control the generation seed.
